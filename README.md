# Design and Analysis of Algorithms: Assignment 3, Boyer-Moore String Search

## Overview
The task focuses on implementing the BMSearch program, which utilizes the Boyer-Moore string search algorithm to search for a target string within a plain text file.

In this part of the assignment, I implemented the BMSearch algorithm. The BMSearch program reads a precomputed skip array from a file and uses it to search for a target string within a plain text document. The program outputs each line containing the target string, regardless of how many times the target string appears in that line.

### Note:
This was a pair programming assignment but I didn't have a partner so the code for creating the skip array table is missing.
